# LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)

**Overview:**
LIME is an explainable AI (XAI) technique designed to provide interpretable explanations for predictions made by complex machine learning models, especially black-box models. The focus is on generating locally faithful and human-understandable explanations for individual instances.

**Steps:**
1. **Select an Instance:**
   - Choose a specific instance for explanation (data point or input).

2. **Perturbations:**
   - Create perturbations with small random changes to explore local model behavior.

3. **Predictions:**
   - Obtain predictions for perturbed instances from the black-box model.

4. **Weighted Sampling:**
   - Select a subset of perturbed instances based on proximity to the original instance.

5. **Fit an Interpretable Model:**
   - Train a simple, interpretable model (e.g., linear regression) on the selected subset.

6. **Generate Explanation:**
   - Use the interpretable model's coefficients to explain feature importance for the instance.

**Goal:**
By approximating the black-box model's behavior locally with a simpler model, LIME aims to make model predictions more interpretable and understandable, facilitating trust and transparency in AI systems.

**Applicability:**
LIME can be applied to various machine learning models, including image classifiers, natural language processing models, and others, making it a versatile tool for explainability in AI applications.
